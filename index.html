                Hanover is a borough in York County, Pennsylvania, 19 miles (31 km) southwest of York and 54 miles (87
                km) north-northwest of Baltimore, Maryland and is 5 miles (8.0 km) north of the Mason-Dixon line.
                Hanover is named after the German city of Hannover.

                    In 1727, John Digges, an Irish nobleman of Prince George's County, Maryland, obtained a grant of
                    10,000 acres (40 km2) of land where Hanover is now located from Charles Calvert, the fourth Lord
                    Baltimore. The area was called Digges Choice, and in 1730, a group of Catholics started the
                    settlement that became known as the Conewego Settlement. Settlers from both Maryland and
                    Pennsylvania began moving into the area in the 1730s. At this time, Maryland and Pennsylvania did
                    not agree on the northern border of Maryland and the southern border of Pennsylvania, and the area
                    that is now Hanover was in the disputed area claimed by both states. This led to numerous disputes
                    about property ownership from the 1730s until 1760. The dispute was settled when Maryland and
                    Pennsylvania hired British experts Charles Mason and Jeremiah Dixon to survey what became known as
                    the Mason–Dixon Line.

                    In 1745, a Scot-Irishman named Richard McAllister purchased the tract of land upon which the
                    original town of Hanover was built. McAllister was a Presbyterian who had recently migrated from the
                    Cumberland Valley. Hanover at that time was covered with a dense forest of hickory, walnut, and oak
                    trees. McAllister erected a log house at what is now the corner of Baltimore and Middle streets, and
                    opened a store and tavern. In 1763, McAllister divided his farm into lots and founded the town of
                    Hanover. German settlers nicknamed the settlement "Hickory Town" after the thick groves of hickory
                    trees that grew in the area.Tanner's choice of the name came from the fact that he was a native of
                    Hannover, Germany. The town's
                    founders, who wanted to please the German settlers, agreed to the name. Hanover was also sometimes
                    referred to as "McAllister's Town" in its early years.
